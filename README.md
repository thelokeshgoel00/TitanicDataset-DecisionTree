# TitanicDataset-DecisionTree
This Repo Uses Dataset from Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster, a kaggle contest <br>
I have used decision trees to implement this.<br>
Custom Function is made.<br>
Then I have also compared the results with sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier and sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier <br>
Minor changes might be needed to run as run all won't work
## Requirements
- Python3
- scipy/sklearn
- numpy
- pandas
